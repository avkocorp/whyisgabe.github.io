    <h2 class="projectitem"><b>The Mayans</b><br/>The Mayans created many technological advancements for their time. They made big advancements in the medical field with band aids made of hair, prosthesis, and pain killers. These innovative people lived on the Yucatan Peninsula and was divided into city-states that had a ruler for each one. These city-states had huge towers and temples, all built by the Maya. They were polytheistic, meaning they believed in multiple gods, and often mad human sacrifices, which was an honor in their culture. The Maya had many more advancements for the time in Mesoamerica, including a writing system of hieroglyphics, a set of numerals, and 3 different calendar systems, including our modern day one - Haab (365 days), Long Count (2,880,000 days, ended in 2012), and the Gregorian Calendar (Modern-Day Calendar). In larger and more important cities, there often were many sweat baths and saunas to cleanse themselves of impurities. You would also find a court for an ancient version of basketball called "Ulanna", which was played by getting a hard ball, or human head, through an impossibly small hole.<br/>The Mayans disappeared around 900AD and it is unknow what happened to them, but it has been theorized that there was a drought or that they started starving, and migrated to somewhere else where they could have a more reliable source of food.</h2>
